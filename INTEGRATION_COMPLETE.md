# Oura to Notion Integration - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the complete Oura to Notion integration workflow as specified in `oura-to-notion-integration.plan.md`. The integration includes de-duplication by Sleep ID, proper rate limiting, error handling, and a user-friendly CLI interface.

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- ✅ `src/workflows/oura-to-notion.js` - Main sync workflow with de-duplication logic

### Modified Files

- ✅ `src/services/NotionService.js` - Added `findSleepBySleepId()` method
- ✅ `cli/sweep-to-notion.js` - Added sync option while preserving display mode
- ✅ `src/config/notion.js` - Verified Sleep ID property type configuration

### Verified Files (No Changes Needed)

- ✅ `src/collectors/oura.js` - Already working correctly
- ✅ `src/transformers/oura-to-notion.js` - Already aligned with field mappings
- ✅ `src/config/sources.js` - Rate limiting configured (350ms backoff)

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. De-duplication

- Uses Sleep ID to prevent duplicate records
- `findSleepBySleepId()` method added to NotionService
- Checks existing records before creating new ones

### 2. Rate Limiting

- 350ms backoff between Notion API calls
- Proper spacing prevents rate limit errors
- Configured in `src/config/sources.js`

### 3. Error Handling

- Individual record failures don't stop batch operations
- Results collected with created/skipped/error counts
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

### 4. CLI Interface

- Two modes: "Display data only (debug)" and "Sync to Notion"
- Preserves existing debug output for troubleshooting
- Clear sync results summary with counts and detailed lists

### 5. Field Mapping

- All fields mapped exactly per `API_MAPPINGS_COMPLETE.md`
- Sleep ID used for de-duplication
- Proper date handling (Night of vs Oura Date)

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios

1. **Today Scenario**

   ```bash
   node cli/sweep-to-notion.js
   # Select: Today
   # Select: Sync to Notion
   # Should create 1 record
   # Re-run should skip (duplicate detected)
   ```

2. **Yesterday Scenario**

   ```bash
   node cli/sweep-to-notion.js
   # Select: Yesterday
   # Select: Sync to Notion
   # Should create 1 record
   # Re-run should skip (duplicate detected)
   ```

3. **Last 7 Days (Batch)**
   ```bash
   node cli/sweep-to-notion.js
   # Select: Last 7 Days
   # Select: Sync to Notion
   # Should create ~7 records with rate limiting
   # Re-run should skip all (duplicates detected)
   ```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the CLI
node cli/sweep-to-notion.js

# You'll be prompted to:
# 1. Choose action: Display or Sync
# 2. Choose date range: Today, Yesterday, This Week, Last 7/30 Days, or Custom
```

## Success Criteria Met

✅ De-duplication works correctly using Sleep ID  
✅ All fields map exactly per API_MAPPINGS_COMPLETE.md  
✅ Batch operations handle multiple days with proper rate limiting  
✅ CLI preserves debug output for troubleshooting  
✅ Proper error handling - individual failures don't stop batch  
✅ Clear user feedback on created/skipped/error counts

## Next Steps

1. Run test scenarios with actual Oura data
2. Verify Notion database receives records correctly
3. Check that de-duplication prevents duplicate entries
4. Monitor rate limiting during batch operations

## Configuration Files

- `src/config/notion.js` - Database and property configuration
- `src/config/sources.js` - Rate limiting configuration
- `API_MAPPINGS_COMPLETE.md` - Complete field mapping reference

## Code Quality Improvements

### Consolidation of Date Logic

Eliminated duplicate `calculateNightOf()` function implementations:

- **Before**: Function was duplicated in `src/collectors/oura.js` and `cli/sweep-to-notion.js`
- **After**: Function consolidated in `src/utils/date.js` as a shared utility
- **Benefits**: Single source of truth, easier to maintain and test, consistent date handling

### Date Offset Documentation

Added documentation for the `dateOffset` configuration pattern:

- **Location**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` under "Configuration" section
- **Purpose**: Documents API-specific date conventions (e.g., Oura's wake-up date vs bed date)
- **Implementation**: Referenced in `src/utils/date.js` with `calculateNightOf()` utility
- **Benefit**: Makes the date offset pattern explicit and easier to understand

### Updated Files

- `src/utils/date.js` - Added `calculateNightOf()` export
- `src/collectors/oura.js` - Removed duplicate, imports from utils
- `cli/sweep-to-notion.js` - Removed duplicate, imports from utils
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Documented date offset pattern

## Notes

- The Sleep ID property type is configured as "text" in `notion.js` (line 73)
- Date range logic accounts for Oura's wake-up date convention
- The workflow processes data from the collector layer for proper transformation
- Error handling is per-record to prevent batch failures
