## Key Querying Notes

1. **Filter by date properties, not relations.** To find "tasks due today," filter Tasks by "Due Date", not by week or rock relations.
2. **Date property format:** Dates use expanded format: `date:Date:start`, `date:Date:end`, `date:Date:is_datetime`.
3. **Relations use emoji prefixes.** The relation property names include emojis: "⏰ 2026 Weeks", "✅ 2026 Tasks", "🪨 2026 Rocks", etc.
4. **Status values include emojis.** Always use the full status string including the emoji: "🔴 To Do", not "To Do".
5. **Trips use multi_select for Subcategory.** Events use single select. Don't confuse them.
6. **Rocks have two status properties.** "Status" tracks progress (To Do → Done). "Retro" tracks retrospective assessment (Not Ranked → Achieved/Failed/Progress).
